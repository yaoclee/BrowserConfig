# TimeFocus App Icons

## How to generate icons:

1. Open `generate-icons.html` in your browser
2. Right-click on each canvas image and save as PNG
3. Save them in this `icons/` folder with the following names:
   - icon-72x72.png
   - icon-96x96.png
   - icon-128x128.png
   - icon-144x144.png
   - icon-152x152.png
   - icon-192x192.png
   - icon-384x384.png
   - icon-512x512.png

## Alternative method:

1. Open browser console on any page
2. Copy and paste the content of `create-basic-icons.js`
3. Press Enter to execute
4. Download the generated icons to this folder

## Temporary solution:

Until you generate the icons, you can use any 192x192 and 512x512 PNG images as placeholders.
The PWA will still work, but may show a default icon.

## Icon Design:

The current design features:
- Blue background (#007bff)
- White clock face
- Clock hands showing time
- Simple, recognizable design suitable for app icons
